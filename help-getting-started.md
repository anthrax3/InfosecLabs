# Help getting started

If you are new to security and need help getting started with the lab you can start here to get some assistance getting started.

When you first join the lab you will land on a website. This is NOT!! the entire lab. The lab emulates a full penetration testing experience and gaining access to this system will only be the first step. Here is a few things you can do to get started.

* Run a port scan on the lab website(avoid default Nmap scans)
* Try to discovery any remote administration ports
* Attempt to gain access through web vulnerabilities

Learning about web application vulnerabilities and running port scans can go a long way in this first stage of the lab. If you still need help you can check the [start-here](https://github.com/SDHackers/start-here) repo.
